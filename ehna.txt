This code trains a neural network model called EHNA (Echo State Network with Attention) to predict the adjacency matrix of a time-varying graph. The model takes in a tensor of size (batch_size, num_timesteps, num_nodes, num_features) as input, where num_nodes is the number of nodes in the graph, num_timesteps is the number of time steps, and num_features is the number of input features. The model consists of an RNN layer and a fully connected layer, and it outputs a tensor of size (batch_size, num_nodes * num_nodes) as output, where each element represents an edge in the adjacency matrix.

The code first loads the input data from pickle files and converts them to PyTorch tensors. The data consists of two lists: adj_time_list and adj_orig_dense_list. The adj_time_list contains the time-stamped adjacency matrices of the graph, and the adj_orig_dense_list contains the corresponding dense adjacency matrices. The code then creates a list of features for each time step and converts the list to a PyTorch tensor. The target tensor is also created by reshaping the adj_orig_dense_list tensor.

The code then splits the dataset into training and validation sets and creates PyTorch dataloaders for the two sets. It initializes the EHNA model and defines the loss function and optimizer. It then sets the device to either CPU or GPU and specifies the number of epochs. The code trains the model for the specified number of epochs and stores the training and validation losses and accuracies for each epoch.
