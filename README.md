# VGRNN_DYNRNN_EHNA

## VGRNN
## usage
```
python3 VGRNN_prediction.py
```

## output
```
The output indicates the loss values (kld_loss, nll_loss, and loss) for each epoch, as well as the performance of the model on link prediction and new link prediction tasks (measured by link_prd_auc_mean, link_prd_ap_mean, new_link_prd_auc_mean, and new_link_prd_ap_mean).

The link prediction and new link prediction tasks are standard benchmarks for evaluating the performance of graph neural networks. The link prediction task aims to predict whether an edge exists between two nodes, while the new link prediction task aims to predict the existence of new edges that were not present in the original graph.

The AUC and AP (average precision) values for link prediction and new link prediction indicate the performance of the model on these tasks. A higher AUC or AP value indicates better performance.

Overall, the output suggests that the VGRNN model is being trained successfully, with the loss values decreasing over time and the performance on link prediction and new link prediction tasks improving. However, it is difficult to draw more specific conclusions without more information about the data and the specific implementation of the VGRNN model.
